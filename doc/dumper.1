.SH NAME
dumper \- a multi\-radix file dump program
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CR]dumper [\-c \-n \-r \-v] [\-\-help] [[\-d \-h \-o] [file ...]]\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
For each operand that refers to a regular file, or a symbolic or hard
link to a regular file, dumper displays a numeric and printable
character representation of the bytes in the file, sequentially.
This format is often referred to as a radix dump.
If no operands are given, dumper accepts input from stdin.
When the special name \[lq]\-\[rq] is given as an argument, dumper reads
from stdin until end of file.
All of the files named on the command line are processed in the order
specified.
The last \f[B]\-d\f[R], \f[B]\-h\f[R], or \f[B]\-o\f[R] that precedes a
file name controls the radix for the dump of that file.
.PP
The following options are available:
.TP
\f[CR]\-c\f[R]
columns alternate with highlights using VT/ANSI escape codes
.TP
\f[CR]\-d\f[R]
dump using decimal numbers
.TP
\f[CR]\-h\f[R]
dump using hexadecimal numbers; this is the default
.TP
\f[CR]\-\-help\f[R]
a synonym for \-v
.TP
\f[CR]\-n\f[R]
emit the name of a file on a separate line immediately before the start
of its content dump
.TP
\f[CR]\-o\f[R]
dump using octal numbers
.TP
\f[CR]\-r\f[R]
reset the offset counter for each file when dumping multiple files; the
default is to keep a running offset as if all files were concatenated
.TP
\f[CR]\-v\f[R]
display version information and usage synopsis
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The C Library may be locale\-aware, in which case the standard locale
environment variables may affect the processing of bytes for ASCII
output.
The behavior with collating sequences other than US ASCII is not
specified.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The dumper utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH EXAMPLES
Dump the contents of the file /bin/ls in hexadecimal mode, without
column highlighting:
.IP
.EX
$ dumper /bin/ls
.EE
.PP
Dump the contents of stdin, /bin/ls, and /etc/motd with different
radices:
.IP
.EX
$ dumper \-d \- \-o /bin/ls \-h /etc/motd
.EE
.PP
Dump the contents of stdin, /bin/ls, and /etc/motd with different
radices, resetting the offset for each file, emitting the name of each
file, and highlighting alternating columns in the radix dump:
.IP
.EX
$ dumper \-d \- \-o /bin/ls \-h /etc/motd \-c \-r \-n
.EE
.SH SEE ALSO
hexdump(1), od(1), xxd(1)
.SH HISTORY
A dumper command appeared on select SunOS 4.1, NeXTStep 2.0, and MS\-DOS
3.x\-6.x systems at Rose\-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1991.
.SH BUGS
The behavior on very large files is not known.
